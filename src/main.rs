    As this is an operating system, the comodities of the standard library can't be used
    since we need a program that can run on the bare minimum. We will have to implement
    everything from scratch.

#![no_main]
    We need to disable the default main entry point provided by Rust.
    The linker looks for a function named `_start` so we override it.
